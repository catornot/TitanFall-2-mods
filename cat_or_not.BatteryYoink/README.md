# Battery Yoink
This is a gamemode replacing FFA. 
1. To get points in this gamemode you have to collect batteries from glowing red npcs. 
2. Then you need to bring the batteries to shop. 
3. Near the shop you can jump yo get the points or crouch to get amped wepons for 1 battery (3 batteries = flight core for 40 seconds).
You get highlighted if you have 2 or more batteries.
